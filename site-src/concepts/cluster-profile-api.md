# ClusterProfile API Overview

This document provides an overview of the [ClusterProfile API](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-inventory-api?tab=readme-ov-file#cluster-profile-api).

![Alt](../images/cluster-profile-api.png "ClusterProfile API")

A Cluster Profile is a namespace-level resource and essentially represents an individual member of the Cluster Inventory
that details properties and status of a cluster. This API proposes a standardized interface that defines how cluster information should be presented
and interacted with across different platforms and implementations.

You can read more details about the API in the [KEP-4322](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-multicluster/4322-cluster-inventory/README.md).

## Terminology

- **Cluster Inventory**: A conceptual term referring to a collection of clusters. A cluster inventory may or may not represent
a [ClusterSet](../api-types/cluster-set.md). A cluster inventory is considered a clusterSet if all its member clusters adhere to the 
[namespace sameness](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-multicluster/namespace-sameness-position-statement.md) principle.

- **Cluster Manager**: An entity that creates the ClusterProfile API object per member cluster,
  and keeps their status up-to-date. Each cluster manager MUST be identified with a unique name.  
  Each ClusterProfile resource SHOULD be managed by only one cluster manager. A cluster manager SHOULD
  have sufficient permission to access the member cluster to fetch the information so it can update the status
  of the ClusterProfile API resource.

- **ClusterProfile API Consumer**: the person running the cluster managers
  or the person developing extensions for cluster managers for the purpose of
  workload distribution, operation management etc.
